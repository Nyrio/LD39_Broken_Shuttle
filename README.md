Ludum Dare 39 - Broken Shuttle
===

This is my participation for Ludum Dare 39. Theme: "running out of power".
It's a physics puzzle game where you control a shuttle running out of power, and you must use gravity to save energy and reach the space station.

## Installation

- **Windows**: unzip the files and run `game.exe`.
- **Linux**: you must have Python and PyGame installed (`pip install pygame`), and you can run the game with `python3 game.pyw`. If the game doesnâ€™t start, try with `pip3` (or `python3-pip`), it may be that you have installed `pygame` On Python 2.

## Controls

Mouse buttons (more details in game).
